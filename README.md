#### Algorithms: ####
1. To find all paths between 2 vertices
2. Ford Fulkerson Algorithm
3. To find k cores (Connected components after all vertices with degree less than k have been removed)
4. To find the k numbers that occur the most frequently in a vector
5. Kruskal's algorithm
6. To find the (a) mother vertex
7. To find path length greater than k
8. Prim's Algorithm
9. Union Find using rank and compression (not optimized)
10. Union Find
11. To find the shortest path from one prime to another while changing a single digit at a time, every resulting digit also being a prime.
